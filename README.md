# English Premier League Web Scraping & Analysis

Using Python for web scraping, I scraped useful statistics, using BeautifulSoup, requests and JSON, from data available on the various websites regarding the English Premier League.<br>
Performed data engineering tasks such as data transformation, cleaning, filtering, imputing and so on to be able to perform further analysis. Using the historical data, we used visual notations and charts to observe pattern and answer multiple predefined hypothesis. 
<br>These predefined hypothesis include but are not limited to:
* Is goal scoring abilities of player by heading be directly influenced by their height?
* Is the goal difference figure of a team any indication of their standing in the league table?
* Is there any corelation between the amount of ball posession a team gains and the victory of the team?
